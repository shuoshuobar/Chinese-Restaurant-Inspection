# Health Code Violations Spark Chinese Restaurant Closures

## Goal:
Analyze and visualize the distribution of the top 20 health code violations at NYC Chinese restaurants in 2024.

## Findings:
1. Improper temperature control for hot and cold foods leads the cause for Chinese restaurant closures.
2. Queens borough sees the most Chinese restaurant closures over five years.

## Process of Data Collection:
Collected Chinese restaurant inspections and violations data from NYC Open Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Chinese-Restaurants/w3z6-mr9h/about_data.
   
## Process of Data Analysis:
1. Extracted restaurant name, borough, inspection year and violation description from the dataset
2. Created a treemap, color-coding to indicate the frequency of health code violations in 2024
3. Outlined the top violations, frequent closing and reopening of two Chinese restaurants

## Skills/Approaches in Use:
1. Python - Pandas: data organizing 
2. Excel - minor dataset tweaks
3. Python - Treemap making
4. Illustrator: Responsive graph editing and exporting with ai2html
5. HTML: Webpage design - side by side timeline design

## Limitation/Looking Ahead:
1. The treemap is responsive, but there are currently too much text information on it, making it hard to read and need to change the font aestheticallyã€‚
